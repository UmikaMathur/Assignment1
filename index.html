	<h1>Assignment #1</h1>

		<p> Something that the article made me realize is that in today's world of information overload, everything is calculated or predicted by calculations and we are driven by the motivation to KNOW everything. But this year especially because of Covid I realized that everything is unpredictable and I think as an artist I was impacted by realizing that we have the ability to help others look at life in another perspective especially through everything thatâ€™s happening now. So if anything now is the time to make art and inspire others to think about certain topics and ideas which is important right now.</p>
